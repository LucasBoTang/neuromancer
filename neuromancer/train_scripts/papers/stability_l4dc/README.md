## LPV Net Implementation
The `lpv` routine used to generate linear parameter-varying affine maps from feedforward neural networks is implemented in `lpv.py`. Another variant which supports batch processing is available&mdash;`lpv_batched`&mdash;though the plotting code does not support it.

## Activation Stability Plots (Figure 1)
These plots are generated by the `mk_activation_plots.py` script; run it directly to generate them.

## Phase Portraits and Eigenvalue Spectra Plots (Figures 2 and 4)
These plots are generated over a large space of activation functions, structured linear maps, spectral constraints, and network depths. The main script for generating the plots we used for our empirical study is `mk_phase_and_spectra_plots.py`. The plotting routines that drive the script are defined in `phase_plots.py` and `eigen_plots.py`.

Because `mk_phase_and_spectra_plots.py` employs a grid search over such a large space of network configurations, generating all the plots will take some time. To generate plots for a specific set of systems, use the `mk_phase_and_spectra_subset_plots.py` script; here you can specify a list of systems rather than hyperparameter ranges to constrain plotting to these systems only.
